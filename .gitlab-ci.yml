# .gitlab-ci.yml — mboxMinerva CI/CD Pipeline with git-crypt enforcement
# ============================================================================
# Stages: lint → test → security → build → release
# New: git-crypt unlock before any job that touches vault/ or PII modules
# Required CI/CD Variables (Settings → CI/CD → Variables):
#   - GPG_PRIVATE_KEY: base64-encoded GPG private key (git-crypt unlock)
#   - GPG_PASSPHRASE: passphrase for the GPG key (if protected)
# ============================================================================



stages:
  - build_infra
  - app_test

variables:
  # Disable per-build isolation so that we can see the previous images on the host
  FF_NETWORK_PER_BUILD: "false"


# JOB 1: The Builder
# Usage: Builds the image ONLY if you touch files in 'docker/'
rebuild_ruby_base:
  stage: build_infra
  # Use generic docker client; it talks to your mapped /var/run/docker.sock (podman)
  image: docker:cli
  variables:
    # Disable TLS since we are talking to a local Unix socket

  script:
    - echo "Detected changes in build context. Rebuilding base image on Host..."
    # This 'docker build' actually runs on the HOST machine because of the socket mapping.
    # It updates the 'ruby:local-patched' tag in the host's storage.
    - podman build --layers -t ruby:local-patched -f docker/Dockerfile .
  rules:
    # CONDITION: Only run if these files change in the commit/MR
    - changes:
        - docker/Dockerfile
        - docker/**/*
    # FALLBACK: Allow manual triggering in the UI if you ever need to force a rebuild (e.g. clean host)
    - when: manual
      allow_failure: true

# JOB 2: The Consumer
# Usage: Runs your actual tests using the image from Job 1
run_tests:
  stage: app_test
  # Because of pull_policy = ["if-not-present"], the Runner looks for this tag
  # on the host first. If Job 1 ran, it sees the new one. If Job 1 skipped, it sees the old one.
